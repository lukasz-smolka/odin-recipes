        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Everyone needs a tried-and-true recipe for simple baked chicken breasts in their back pocket. On the hunt for the perfect one? We've got you covered with this top-rated recipe — it's versatile, crowd-pleasing, and (best of all) incredibly easy!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon coarse sea salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's®), or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chicken broth or water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and seasoning. Place chicken in a broiler pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove chicken to a plate. Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off the bottom with a flat-edged wooden spatula. Add more broth if needed to dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery.</li>
            <li>To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken.</li>
        </ol>
